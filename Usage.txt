
 This function helps in Adding a little GUI effect into your batch program...
 It Prints simple Button on the cmd console at specified X Y co-ordinate...
 After printing, Returns the area of the button on CMD and the Inverted color
 You can use this information in the main program with GetInput.exe Plugin of
 Batch. And, it will make your life much more easier than before.
 

 Syntax: call Button [Item 1] [Item 2] [Item 3] ... X _Var_Box _Var_Hover
 Syntax: call Button [help | /? | -h | -help]
 Syntax: call Button ver

 Where:-

 [Item] is short for 	= [X] [Y] [color] "[Button Text]"

 [X]	= X-ordinate of top-left corner of Button
 [Y]	= Y-co_ordinate of top-left corner of Button
 ver	= Version of Button function
 [Item #]= The Items to display. And, Item Represents elements as told above.
 X 	= Here, the Single 'X' (Must be third last element) indicates the Loop
	 Sequence breaker for the Function. After 'X' You need to provide two -
	 Variables. Which will return the Corresponding values for the GetInput
	 Batch Plugin by aacini.
 _Var_Box = The Second last parameter, which is name of the variable to save
	 the values of All Buttons on the console.
 _Var_Hover = The Last parameter, which is name of the variable to save the 
	 mouse hover color for each button seperately.

 Use the above two output variables with 'GetInput.exe' Plugin as follows:
 GetInput /M %_Var_Box% /H %_Var_Hover%

 This version 2.0 of Button function contains much more GUI Capabilities.
 As it uses batbox.exe and calls it only once at the end of calculation...
 For the most efficient output. This ver. uses GetInput By Aacini too. For the
 Advanced Output on the console.
